                    <h2><a href="the_godfather.html">The Godfather</a></h2>
                    <p>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel
                        by Mario Puzo. The story follows the powerful Corleone crime family in post–World War II New
                        York.</p>
                    <p>The head of the family, Vito Corleone (the Godfather), is a respected and feared mafia boss.
                        When he is nearly assassinated by rival criminals, his youngest son, Michael Corleone, who
                        initially wanted nothing to do with the family business, is forced to step in to protect his
                        father.</p>
                    <p>As Michael gets more involved, he becomes deeply entangled in the world of organized crime. Over
                        time, he transforms from a quiet outsider to a ruthless and strategic leader. After Vito's
                        death, Michael becomes the new Godfather and eliminates all threats to the family, securing
                        their power.</p>
                    <p>The film explores themes of loyalty, power, family, betrayal, and the dark side of the American
                        dream. It's considered one of the greatest and most influential films in cinematic history.</p>

                    <h2><a href="the_dark_knight.html">The Dark Knight</a></h2>
                    <p>The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and the second installment
                        in *The Dark Knight Trilogy*. The movie follows Bruce Wayne, who fights crime in Gotham City as
                        Batman.</p>
                    <p>In this film, Batman teams up with Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to
                        take down organized crime. However, their efforts are challenged by a new and dangerous criminal
                        mastermind: The Joker.</p>
                    <p>The Joker spreads chaos across Gotham, testing Batman’s morals and pushing the city to the edge
                        of destruction. He targets people close to Batman and manipulates Harvey Dent into becoming the
                        villain Two-Face.</p>
                    <p>Batman ultimately takes the blame for crimes he didn’t commit in order to protect Dent’s
                        reputation and maintain hope in Gotham. The film ends with Batman becoming a fugitive, choosing
                        to be the "silent guardian" and "dark knight" the city needs.</p>
                    <p>The movie is known for its deep themes of chaos vs. order, heroism, sacrifice, and moral
                        complexity — and features an iconic performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker.</p>
